      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a student learning web development</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala. I was adopted at 1 year and a half and have lived in Canada ever since.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Making music, sports such as hockey, basketball, soccer, photography, writing, and just lounging listening to music.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to eventually work in cyber security.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Midtown, in Toronto, Ontario.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I know that coding is a very valuable tool/skill to have, along with understanding how all of these programs work together. With many retailers moving to just online sales, they are not the only industry relying heavily on tech. I hope that after this program that I am able to open some doors, to allow myself to excel in a field I enjoy. </p>
